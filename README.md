# uAssign

uAssign is a system to manage *NIX terminal assignments. It uses Docker
containers to build real, interactive environments to an instructor's
specification, proxying a terminal over WebSockets to a user. The full
lifecycle of containers is managed, including the ability for users to
disconnect and reconnect with their state preserved.
